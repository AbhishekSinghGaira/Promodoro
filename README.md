## The Pomodoro Technique for Exam Preparation

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses timed intervals of focused work followed by short breaks. For competitive exam preparation, this technique can be particularly effective:

1. **Focus Sessions**: Dedicate each Pomodoro to a specific topic or problem set.
2. **Short Breaks**: Use these to refresh your mind between topics.
3. **Long Breaks**: Take longer breaks after completing multiple sessions to prevent burnout.
4. **Track Progress**: Use the streak feature to maintain consistency in your preparation.
